                                                      Our Password Cracking Algorithm
	Our project consists of 22 lines of code and has the purpose of solving a password with any given number, 
	letter, and special character combination. The purpose of this algorithm is to show how inefficient brute 
	force programming is and how other solutions are necessary in order to solve more complicated passwords. 
	It takes in an input with a maximum of four characters and iterates character combinations, followed by 
	number combinations, and finally special character combinations. If we were to include more than four 
	characters, the process would take significantly longer, and many interpreters would kill the process 
	before it even finishes due to the immense amount of processing power expended. In order to visualize 
	the inefficiency of our program, we added a stopwatch function. This function returns the elapsed time 
	from when the algorithm starts and ends.
